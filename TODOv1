----InchiGen.py----
GenDiastereomers must adapt to the number of stereocentres defined (none or a list)

---Tinker.py---
Add GetFilesToRun function

Tinker.RunTinker is responsible for checking any existing files

Tinker.ReadConformers must check that the right conformers are read into the right Isomer structure

---MacroModel.py----
responsible for loading the required SCHRODINGER module

---Jaguar.py----
responsible for loading the required SCHRODINGER module

---ConfPrune.pyx---
Now should be fully self-contained and only work with given geometries and return less (pruned) geometries

---Gaussian.py---
separate Darwin and Ziggy code out in GaussianDarwin.py and GaussianZiggy.py - while reusing Gaussian.py code

--all DFT packages---
must expose DFT.SetupNMRCalcs, DFT.SetupOptCalcs, DFT.SetupECalcs,  DFT.RunCalcs, DFT.ReadNMRShifts, DFT.ReadEnergies, DFT.ReadGeometries

DFT.RunCalcs must check what files are missing, and if existing files are valid
RunCalcs also must check that hard structure count limit is not exceeded


---NMRAnalysis.py----
Should be the new self-contained entry point for all NMR analysis

Gets computational data (geometries, NMRshifts, energies) and settings (with NMR file/folder, solvent, stats file)

Does the Boltzmann scaling itself

Does all the console, text, report output itself
